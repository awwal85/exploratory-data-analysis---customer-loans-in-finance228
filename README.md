## Introduction
This project is about a large financial institution, where managing loans is a critical component of business operations.

## Goals
With data from past customers who took loan from the company, I have the objective to: 
1. gain a comprehensive understanding of the loan portfolio data;
2. perform exploratory data analysis on the loan portfolio, using various statistical and data visualisation techniques to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the loan data;
3. gain a deeper understanding of the risk and return associated with the business' loans; and
4. improve the performance and profitability of the loan portfolio,
